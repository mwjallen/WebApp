<p>Jack and Jim went into partnership and created a health club a few years ago. Both have been friends for long and both have passion for sports and healthy living. Since it was created, it has grown successfully and now they wish to invest in its improvements. They would like to present it as the 21st century approach for promoting healthy living. </p>

<p>The club has employed the 8 mentors, 2 crèche minders and 3 pool attendants on full time and 2 receptionists on part time employment. The mentors act as instructors during the sessions for providing supervision. The pool attendants are qualified life guards and monitor the pool usage and provide assistance. The club also hires instructors on contract for sessions conducted in the studio halls. These instructors get paid on the number of sessions on hourly basis. The spa and the massage rooms are contracted to practising qualified staff that are self-employed and use the facilities and provide the services. They pay the club a small commission for renting the facilities. They are instructed to use the material and items as provided by the club.</p>
