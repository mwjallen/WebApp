<p>Mentors schedule counselling sessions with each member. At this session the mentor will get an update on the health check of the member. Based on the progress being made, the member will be advised to amend the usage plan. The updated plan will be created on the system. This will be monitored through the regular usage log. This report log will be used by mentors to assist them for their counselling and the club to further the business by identifying opportunities and/or weaknesses.</p>
<p>Currently there are attendants in each room/facility. They manually log the user Ids on attendance sheets. This is being replaced with an electronic system used to log in/out the user. This system should also let the attendant use and interact with the other systems in the club. PC based system is being considered and they need to be networked. A base configuration PC is being considered with optional items added to the unit as per the individual needs for each room as cost effective solution. If total cost for customised units is cheaper or similar in price, they will be considered as an option. Suitable applications need to be purchased for the PC units. PCs need to be suitable as multimedia and
computing units. Ability to stream multimedia content to the display monitors within rooms will be a critical feature.</p>
<p>Studios need access to music and videos during the sessions. Pre-compiled playlists are used for different sessions. Every attendant will need access to central system to log in/out users, in addition to the calendar and scheduling of appointments. Display monitors are required in the gym and the therapy rooms to maintain the ambience through customised presentations and videos played in loops. Display monitors in the pool areas provide instructional videos for the sessions and general promotions and offers. The admin office will need to use a centralised system that will contain all the information collected by the business and the business intelligence developed through analytics. Internal communication is done through internal email, instant messaging/chat and phone.</p>
<p>The studio has allocated scheduled sessions for different activities. The instructors select the time slots they wish to work. Each time slot is covered by an instructor. Over the past months there has been distinct increase in the attendance and demand for some sessions. The instructors for these sessions are being considered for full time employment. Along with the usage of the members and guest, the session attendance is also matched with the instructors. This is used for evaluating the returns for each instructor.
The therapy room is rented out as is. Masseuses are charged fixed rent for the usage. They are allowed to make appointments and schedule their own time according to the needs of the members using the facility. At the moment, each room uses and maintains individual calendars and it is the intention to use a central system to manage all the usage based on the member Ids.</p>
