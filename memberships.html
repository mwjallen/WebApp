                  <h1>Memberships</h1>
                  <p>Membership is offered on individual/family basis and each member is allocated a unique ID number. Activities and usage of each member is logged and accessed periodically to aid in improving general health and fitness. Once the member is signed on, the usage cost is allocated on on-going basis. This can be bought as packages (collection of specific units in set combinations) or individual units. Thus each member has the choice to select and use the areas they wish, need or desire. Guests are charged a visiting fee at entry on the day and usage of any facilities during the visit. There are usual discounts for paying for the usage of the facilities in bulk â€“ 6 month, 1 yr, 2 yrs. Payment for such schemes can be set up as direct debit, however opting out prematurely results in payment of full term as set up.</p><br />

                  <h1>Induction</h1>
                  <p>At the induction, each member goes through a routine health check and the data is logged in the system. Attached with this scenario is a Fitness Calculator sheet. The Passive testing section is completed for any new member that joins the club irrespective of the age.</p>
<p>Each member is assigned a health mentor to guide and assist them to use the facilities effectively. These mentors monitor the regular usage, and update the data for health and fitness through periodic checks every 6/12 months. The progress is logged and accessed through the system. During counselling sessions, the members are advised about any changes that could be made to their health plans.</p>
